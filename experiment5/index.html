				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This is an image mutation generator that uses 3 images, the cover art for Sidereal Confluence, the Amongus art, and a picture of my cat. Color is really important to me so I wanted to prioritize it in this project and having images with very distinct color variation helpef</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>To accomplish this, I took samples from pixels on the image and kind of made the pixels larger, then through the mutation it randomly makes some larger than others which "warps" the shape created</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was fun to do! I wish I had more time to work on it but I have been finishing up my work at my lab and it is just overall quite a lot</p>
