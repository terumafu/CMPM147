				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>For this experiment, I wanted to simulate the worlds shown in class. I did this by using noise as a heightmap, then allowing the player to edit the heightmap. The map also periodically breathes as it changes color, giving a calming effect, at least for me.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>To accomplish this, I took the demo code and tweaked the isometric squares to increase in height depending on a fraction of a noise map. I then tweaked the buttonpressed function in the file to affect all neighbouring buttons as well</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was fun to do! I have been feeling pretty stressed lately and watching this kind of calms me down.</p>
